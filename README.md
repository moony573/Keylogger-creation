Keylogger Project — Educational Demonstration
📌 Overview

This repository contains an educational implementation of a Python-based keylogger developed as part of a controlled cybersecurity lab exercise. The project is strictly intended for learning and research purposes only to understand how keyloggers function, their potential risks, and the defensive measures needed to protect against them.

⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is not intended for malicious use. Deploying keyloggers without explicit consent is illegal and unethical. Use this code only in authorized lab environments or on personal systems for educational purposes. The author and contributors hold no responsibility for misuse.
